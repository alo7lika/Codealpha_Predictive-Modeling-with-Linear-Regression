# Codealpha_Predictive-Modeling-with-Linear-Regression
This project demonstrates how to build a predictive model using linear regression to predict a numerical outcome based on one or more features. Using a dataset with a continuous target variable, the project covers data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
